Start any new task by reading the /README.md

There are various docs about what we've learned and done in /docs:

- docs/common-crawl.md shows how to interact with the common crawl api

After any task:

- Run all linters and fix anything that's wrong
- Run all tests and fix anything that's wrong
- Update the readme and docs with anything new you've learned or with changes we've made.
